# Blockchain-Powered Decentralized Identity and Access Management (DIAM)

## Project Overview

A cutting-edge identity management platform that empowers users with complete control over their digital identities, leveraging blockchain technology to provide secure, privacy-preserving, and interoperable identity solutions.

## Key Features

### 1. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)
- Decentralized digital identity creation
- User-controlled identity attributes
- Portable across multiple platforms and services
- Private key-based identity management

### 2. Verifiable Credentials Ecosystem
- W3C Verifiable Credentials (VC) standard compliance
- Cryptographically signed credential issuance
- Zero-knowledge proof authentication
- Granular credential sharing controls

### 3. Smart Contract Access Management
- Blockchain-based access policy enforcement
- Dynamic role-based access control (RBAC)
- Fine-grained permission management
- Automated access revocation and expiration

### 4. Federated Identity Integration
- OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect support
- SAML 2.0 identity provider bridge
- Enterprise single sign-on (SSO) compatibility
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) enhancement

## Technical Architecture

### Identity Layer
- Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)
- Public key infrastructure (PKI)
- Credential revocation mechanisms
- Identity recovery protocols

### Blockchain Infrastructure
- Ethereum-compatible smart contracts
- Layer 2 scaling solutions
- Modular contract design
- Cross-chain identity resolution

### Authentication Protocols
- Decentralized authentication mechanisms
- Selective disclosure of credentials
- Consent-based data sharing
- Cryptographic proof generation

### Identity Storage
- IPFS-based decentralized storage
- Encrypted credential repositories
- Distributed key management
- Secure data fragmentation

## Development Environment
